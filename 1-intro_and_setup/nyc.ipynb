    "Before we dive into building **advanced pipelines, models, and tracking experiments**, we need to establish a **robust production-ready environment**. This ensures that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Experiments are reproducible**  \n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Our workflow is organized and maintainable**  \n",
    "   - Proper imports, library versions, and modular code make it easy for teams to collaborate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Models can be tracked and versioned**  \n",
    "   - Using **MLflow**, we log experiments, hyperparameters, and metrics for easy comparison and auditability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scalability and flexibility**  \n",
    "   - Preconfigured pipelines, preprocessing tools, and ML libraries allow us to handle larger datasets or swap models seamlessly.\n",

    "# 🎛️ Configuration & Reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start modeling, it's crucial to **establish reproducible and scalable experiment settings**. This ensures that results are consistent, experiments are traceable, and your workflow is production-ready.\n",

    "### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reproducibility**\n",
    "   - `RANDOM_STATE = 42`: Ensures that every run produces the same train/test splits, random sampling, and model results.\n",
    "   - `TEST_SIZE = 0.2`: Reserves 20% of the data for final evaluation.\n",
    "   - `VAL_SIZE = 0.2`: Reserves a portion of the training data for validation and hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "   - `CV_FOLDS = 5`: Use 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate models robustly.\n",
    "   - `N_JOBS = -1`: Utilizes all available CPU cores to speed up computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Organized Project Structure**\n",
    "   - `MODEL_DIR = \"models\"`: All trained models are stored in a dedicated folder.\n",
    "   - `EXPERIMENT_DIR = \"experiments\"`: All MLflow experiment logs, metrics, and artifacts are saved in a centralized location.\n",
    "   - `os.makedirs(..., exist_ok=True)`: Ensures directories exist, preventing file errors during training or logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **MLflow Experiment Tracking**\n",
    "   - `mlflow.set_tracking_uri(...)` points MLflow to the experiment folder.\n",
    "   - `mlflow.set_experiment(experiment_name)` creates a named experiment for this project.\n",
    "   - This allows you to **log models, metrics, and hyperparameters**, enabling easy comparison across experiments.\n",
